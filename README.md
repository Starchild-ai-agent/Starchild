# Starchild

Intent-driven trading intelligence. Describe what you want and AI executes.

Vibe it, Earn it

## What is Starchild?

Starchild is a Vibe Trading platform where you describe your trading strategy in plain language, and AI agents build a strategy and execute it for you. Instead of manually setting orders and watching charts, you express intent and Starchild handles the rest, so you can go live your life.

## How We Build

We restructured our entire codebase so AI agents can own it. Not AI-assisted development, but agent-ready development.
